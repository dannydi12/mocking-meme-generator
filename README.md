# Mocking Text Generator

A simplistic web app to generate randomly capitalized text based on user input.

## Motivation

I got tired of having to manually type and capitalize my messages online to mock people. Now, I can easily mock someone with the ease of a simple copy/paste.

## Recommended Usage

It is highly recommended you use this tool to mock Boomers.
